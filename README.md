The incorporation of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ensures a streamlined and secure process, reinforcing the confidentiality and integrity of patient data.
Moreover, This solution embraces Web5's decentralized architecture and deploys cryptographic security measures to fortify patient data against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This commitment to improved data security and privacy aligns with global standards, fostering trust in the healthcare ecosystem.
In addition to data security, this EHR system implements rigorous data quality control measures. This ensures the accuracy and completeness of patient records, promoting reliable and comprehensive healthcare information.
